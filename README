Skeleton project for BDD / Cucumber training

SUT is a dummy Python application, without logic in the beginning. Test interface is a Python command line application.
Use nostetests / specloud to run/write unit tests.

logic.py = SUT logic
gui.py = SUT gui

tests.py = unit tests for logic.py

testapp.py = test interface

In ruby code you can do "call_sut("Command"), which will call the SUT with the given parameter through the test interface app.
Implement the code to logic.py (hint: return whatever you want to check in your ruby script). Gui will also display returned string
