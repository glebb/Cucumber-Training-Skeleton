Skeleton project for BDD / Cucumber training

Because:
   * Learning BDD with Cucumber
   * Demo how to test apps written in "other language" as the test automation tool through test interface.
   * Demo how to test on logic layer outside of GUI.

SUT is a dummy Python application, without logic (in the beginning). Test interface is a Python command line application.
Use nostetests or specloud to run/write unit tests.

logic.py = SUT logic
gui.py = SUT gui

tests.py = unit tests for logic.py

testapp.py = test interface

In ruby you can do "call_sut("Command"), which will call the SUT logic with the given parameter through the test interface app.
Implement the code to logic.py (hint: return whatever you want to check in your ruby script). Gui will also display returned string.
