Skeleton project for BDD / Cucumber training

Because:
   * Learning BDD with Cucumber
   * Demo how to test apps written in "other language" as the test automation tool through test interface. (Python version)
   * Demo how to test on logic layer outside of GUI.

There are two SUT's, one written in Python, one in Ruby.
Both have similar test interfaces.

In ruby you can do "call_sut("Command"), which will call the SUT logic with the given parameter through the test interface app.
(Python verison call_sut_python("Command")

Implement the code to logic file (hint: return whatever you want to check in your ruby script). Gui will also display returned string.
